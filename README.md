This project is a Power BI dashboard made to understand Grofast’s sales performance. I cleaned the data, analyzed sales and products, and created visuals to show trends. The dashboard helps see which products sell the most, which outlets perform well, and how sales change over time. It gives a clear view of the business and helps in making better decisions.
